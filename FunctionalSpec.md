Geopollinator
=============

**The problem:**
 	Geopolitics is a social studies course which requires students to
 	memorize/learn the countries in the world. The difficulty with this
 	is that most websites which offer a way to study countries, either do
 	not have all the countries for one test, and require a student to study
 	part of one test and part of another; or they are simply not specific
 	enough in the maps to cover all the countries covered by the class.

**Our Solution:**
	Create a website that uses a map and prompts the user, asking, "Where
	is this country?" and a point-and-click method of finding those
	countries. You will be able to choose which countries that you would
	like to study. 

**Our visual will be as follows:**
	The home screen will have a select list of commonly studied country
	groups (Europe, Middle East etc.). On the top of the page is the main
	opener [what is an "opener?"], it will have a country selection list, 
	and the user will select
	which countries they wish to study. Based on the farthest to the left,
	to the right, down, and up it will set the area that the program zooms in
	on. If the country is smaller than a certain size, and the user misses
	it, an arrow will point and the area immediately around the country
	will glow. The user will have a zoom option, and a scroll bar on the side.
	This is so that the user can select smaller countries if they are
	studying over a large area. Areas studied can be saved as study
	groups which will be stored as cookies in the users browsers. 
	[Is there some kind of score keeping involved and how would that work?]
	
	[Tere is enough functionality in this following sentence to fill
	an entire section with more detail. Is it realistic to think you
	will accomplish this at all?]Key
	maps and study lists will be available on another few tabs these will
	be for teachers, suggest country lists to study as well as pages to
	print out and test their students on. [What are "key maps" and "study lists"
	and are they integrated somehow with the rest of the site? That is, are 
	there clickable links in them and what do they do? What "pages to print
	out" are there, exactly? Seems like a lot of extras!]
